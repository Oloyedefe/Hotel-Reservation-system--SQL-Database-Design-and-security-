# Hotel-Reservation-system--SQL-Database-Design-and-security-


Project: FLOW HOTEL AND SUITES

⸻

 Overview

This project was developed as part of a university module on Database Management and Security. It involves the design and implementation of a secure hotel reservation system for a fictional business, FLOW HOTEL AND SUITES. The system was built using Oracle Live SQL and includes an Entity-Relationship Model (ERM), realistic dummy data, SQL queries, and a comprehensive technical report.

 Project Scenario

This project centers around the creation of an information system for a hotel named FLOW HOTEL AND SUITES. The system facilitates the booking and management of hotel accommodations, allowing guests to:
	•	Search for available rooms
	•	Make reservations
	•	Customize their stay with preferences

On the administrative side, the system helps:
	•	Managers, owners, and shareholders track revenue
	•	Maintain room inventory and guest records
	•	Handle check-ins and check-outs
	•	Process payments
	•	Generate and manage guest reviews

The system enhances efficiency, improves guest experience, promotes transparency in financial tracking, and supports strategic business decision-making.

 Key Features
	•	 Entity-Relationship Model (ERM): Structured the database around hotel, room, booking, and customer entities.
	•	SQL Queries: Built and tested real SQL queries in Oracle Live SQL to simulate reservations, availability checks, payments, and more.
	•	Database Security Concepts: Applied basic principles of secure database design including access control, data integrity, and minimal exposure.
	•	Detailed Report: Documented the full design process, ERM/ERD, normalization, query implementation, and security considerations.

 Technologies Used
	•	Oracle Live SQL
	•	SQL (DDL, DML, DQL)
	•	ERM/ERD Design Tools (e.g. Lucidchart, dbdiagram.io)
	•	Markdown/pdf for documentation and reporting
