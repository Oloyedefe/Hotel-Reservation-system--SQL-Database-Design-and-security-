üè® Hotel Reservation System ‚Äì SQL Database Design & Security

Project: FLOW HOTEL AND SUITES

‚∏ª

 Overview

This project was developed as part of a university module on Database Management and Security. It involves the design and implementation of a secure hotel reservation system for a fictional business, FLOW HOTEL AND SUITES. The system was built using Oracle Live SQL and includes an Entity-Relationship Model (ERM), realistic dummy data, SQL queries, and a comprehensive technical report.

 Project Scenario

This project centers around the creation of an information system for a hotel named FLOW HOTEL AND SUITES. The system facilitates the booking and management of hotel accommodations, allowing guests to:
	‚Ä¢	Search for available rooms
	‚Ä¢	Make reservations
	‚Ä¢	Customize their stay with preferences

On the administrative side, the system helps:
	‚Ä¢	Managers, owners, and shareholders track revenue
	‚Ä¢	Maintain room inventory and guest records
	‚Ä¢	Handle check-ins and check-outs
	‚Ä¢	Process payments
	‚Ä¢	Generate and manage guest reviews

The system enhances efficiency, improves guest experience, promotes transparency in financial tracking, and supports strategic business decision-making.
